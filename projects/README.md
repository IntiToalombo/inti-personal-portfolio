# Llamas
## Description of the problem.
  
Say we have a population of n llamas. Each year, n/3 llamas are born, and n/4 llamas pass away.
For example if we start with 12 llamas and we want to have  13 llamas we need 1 year, 14 llamas 2 years, 
17 llamas 4 years and so on. Be sure that the initial numer of llamas can't no ber less than 9, because
the llamas pupulation will quickly become stagnant.
